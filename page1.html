  The  <em> window 1.0 </em>  was shown to the public 2 years early but it was on November 20, 1985,
   the Microsoft window company release the<em> window 1.0 </em>  in the United States. <em> window 1.0 </em>  
   was delayed due to the design of the program. Microsoft from the early 80s wanted to 
   create a Graphical user interface, a device that allowed the user to use icons to 
   connect to the electronic (GUI). This was the first big start of the window computer. 
   The lead developer of <em> window 1.0 </em>  is Scoot A. McGregor, the role given by Bill Gates, 
   also known as the co-founder of Microsoft. With the help of Compaq, zenith, and DEC 
   company the<em> window 1.0 </em>  can run on MS-DOS. During that time many computers needed Unix,
    however, window did not use Unix to create their IMB PC, making it more unique than 
    other pc. At that time, the <em> window 1.0 </em>  can perform many features like a calculator, 
    notepad, mini-games, paint, and clock. On the window, you can use a mouse or without the mouse; 
    you can click and drag. <em> window 1.0 </em>  cost $99 at that time when it was out. Some reason <em> window 1.0 </em> 
    was a favorite by people was memory management, downloading a file, or sending files. In the program
     of <em> window 1.0 </em> , there was even an easter egg that showed the developers. And with the support of
    other companies like Compaq, zenith, and DEC; it let window company get more popular over time.
    <em> window 1.0 </em>  was also Microsoft's longest-supported window.
