          Although <em>Window 7</em> was made available on October 22, 2009, 
          it was released on July 22, 2009. The operating system for Microsoft's Windows NT 
          received a big update. <em>Window 7</em> was a very remarkable success for Microsoft because 
          of the increase in pre-orders on amazon. Some of the great improvements it had were the 
          operating system's enhanced performance, more user-friendly design, decreased number of User Account Control pop-ups, and other platform-wide enhancements.
           It was a great computer to use for personal or business. Advances in touch and handwriting recognition, support for virtual hard disks, 
           and better multi-core CPU speed are some of <em>Window 7's</em> new features. <em>Window 7</em> includes an improved multiline calculator with Programmer and Statistics modes as well as 
           unit conversion for length, weight, temperature, and a number of other things. Some things it includes was Tuner Display Color Calibration Wizard, Gadgets, Recovery, Troubleshooting, Workspaces Center, Location and Other Sensors, Credential Manager, Biometric Devices, System Icons, and
            Display are just a few of the many new additions to the Control Panel. Window 7 users can now use a system called Libraries that a new mechanism for managing files that were added puts numerous directories into a new mechanism for managing 
            files and unlike another preview window. The user's private folder and the public folder for each category, 
            including Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos, are automatically formed libraries. 
          Additionally, they modify the taskbar so that you can pin applications to it. <em>Window 7</em> ram was 1 GB and Ram 32- bit or 2 GM RAM.
