        <em>Windows 95</em> was released on July 14, 1995. 
        It was the first operating program in the 9x
         window family, and it was what gave the successor
          of Windows 3.1x. Similar to Windows 1.0, there were 
          numerous new and unique functionalities. Microsoft only
           provided support for them for a year, from December 31, 2000. 
           Early planning and design for <em>Windows 95</em> can be traced to around March 1992, right before the 
           launch of Windows 3.1. At this point, Microsoft's aim was to have a consumer-focused, low-end 
           OS as an upgrade to Windows 3.1 and a high-end, next-generation OS built on Windows NT dubbed 
           Cairo. For the latter method, which served as the basis for the impending "Chicago" version of
            Windows, a 32-bit underlying kernel, filesystem, and device drivers were developed for protect 
            mode in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. <em>Windows 95</em> was created to provide a more stable and 
            effective system while maintaining maximum compatibility with 16-bit Windows and MS-DOS 
            programs and device drivers that were already in use. The 386-enhanced mode of Windows for 
            Workgroups has evolved into the<em>Windows 95</em> architecture. <em>Windows 95</em> improved 32 protected-mode
             apps that were multi-tasked and used 255-character mixed-case file names. <em>Windows 95</em> Manager 
             was also introduced in to show which devices were configured correctly and operating optimally, as well as to give the user the option to override automatic give them a choice of several semi-automatic configurations to free up resources for devices that 
        still required manual configuration.
         It also supported many other new technologies.
